# My Portfolio

Welcome. My name is **Edgars Dudins**. I am a junior **software developer**. In year 2019 I decided to return to Latvia and begin studies at university. I decided to pursue IT (Information Technologies), as I felt this would be the ultimate challenge for me - considering my passion for technology.

So, this is my portfolio. Hope you will enjoy traversing my comments and seeing my thoughts.

I love talking about programming. If you do to, hook me up: `@dudins.lv`.
