# My Portfolio

Welcome. My name is **Edgars Dudins**. I am an aspiring **programmer**. Currently I have been working on developing my *personal portfolio page* and getting a grasp of web development technologies. I must say, web development is a scary place to be. I do, however, thoroughly enjoy playing around with different technologies and working out ways of making things work. This is why I feel I have a great potential to become an amazing programmer and a highly demanded web developer (full stack).

This is my *first repository*. I will use this repository to create my portfolio page and keep learning Git as well as web-development. This readme file will be updated with further information.
